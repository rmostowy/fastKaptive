# fastKaptive

## Introduction

`fastKaptive` is a Blast-based R written software to search and extract capsule synthesis loci in bacterial genomes. It has been used and tested on genomes of the Enterobacteriales, as described in [1]. The code was designed to extract to locus regions, based on a model of *Escherichia coli* [2]:

* *cps* locus region, associated with the synthesis of O-antigens in *E. coli*,
* *kps* locus region, associated with the synthesis of K-antigens in *E. coli*.
